In order to deploy the wiremock service:


- kind create cluster

- kind load docker-image wiremock/wiremock:3.4.2

- kubectl apply -f src/main/resources/k8s/wiremock/

- kubectl apply -f src/main/resources/k8s/wiremock-default-namespace

In order to build and deploy our app/service:

- mvn clean install

- kind load docker-image springcloud/gateway-demo:1.0.0

- kubectl apply -f src/main/resources/k8s/app/

  # exec into the cluster
- docker ps
- docker exec -u 0 --privileged -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash
- kubectl get pods -o wide
- curl 10.244.0.6:8080/services
  both 'wiremock-default-service' and 'wiremock-service' are discovered

- kubectl get pods -o wide
  find the IP of the gateway-demo project then:

- curl 10.244.0.7:8080/wiremock-service/__admin/mappings
- curl 10.244.0.7:8080/wiremock-default-service/__admin/mappings

To see that both work.
